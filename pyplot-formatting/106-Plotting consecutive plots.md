# Plotting Consecutive Plots

### Learning Objectives

* Why Pyplot formatting?
* Plotting consecutive graphs
* Combining the 2 plots into 1



### Pyplot Formatting

Tired of those plain, boring graphs? Want them to convey more information at once? This is the perfect module for you then!

Weâ€™ll be working on the same dataset i.e. on the [Standard Metropolitan Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/Standard_Metropolitan_Areas_Data-data.csv).

### Plotting consecutive plots using Matplotlib

Plotting data on multiple consecutive figures can be done by calling the corresponding graphing functions and displaying each figure consecutively:

### Combining the 2 plots into 1

What happens if you don't use plt.show() after the first figure? Both variables will be plotted in the same figure:
