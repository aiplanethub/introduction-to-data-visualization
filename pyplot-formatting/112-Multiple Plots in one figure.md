## Multiple Plots in 1 Figure

* We can make multiple graphics in one figure. This goes very well for comparing charts or for sharing data from several types of charts easily with a single image.

* The .subplot() method is used to add multiple plots in one figure. It takes three arguments:
  * nrows: number of rows in the figure
  * ncols: number of columns in the figure
  * index: index of the plot

* Let's see how variables are plotted with different row and column configurations in the figures.

* The function subplot creates a figure and a set of subplots. It is a wrapper function to make it convenient to create common layouts of subplots, including the enclosing figure object, in a single call.

* You can even give a Title to your subplots using the suptitle method! No, the 'p' is not a typing mistake.

* The subplot function returns a figure and an Axes object or an array of Axes objects.



## Changing Plot Size

If we call the subplot function without any parameters - like we do in the following example - a Figure object and one Axes object will be returned:

### 1 row and 2 columns - Method 1

### Overlapping Values

* Aren't those overlapping axis values annoying? Matplotlib has a solution for that too.

* Simply put sharey=True inside the subplot function. The two subplots will now share the y axis values.

* Try it out!

### 2 rows and 1 column

### 2 rows and 2 columns

Think of this as a 2$\times$2 grid. You can access the different positions of the axis and plot your graphs there as follows:
